# Pi Converter App â€” Frontend

this project is a simple full stack application built with Svelte on the
frontend and Node / Express on the
[backend](https://github.com/yeraldev/pi-converter-api)

The app is built through the use of components that allow a very good
segmentation and reuse of the same and Svelte functionalities, such as
reactivity, stores, among others.

The general purpose of this app is to obtain values from a server and use them
to calculate interchangeable quantities in and in a bidirectional sense when
data is entered by the user, thus offering a very intuitive and friendly
experience.

All the functionality described above is inspired by the currency converter
offered by the google search engine.
